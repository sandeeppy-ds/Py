'''  learning about datatypes '''

''' python is dynamically typed programing language '''

# where as Java is staticstially typed programing language '''


''' Data Types '''

# int : every non decimal value is an integer
# Float : contains Decimal valuess
#String : Its a character or word
#Boolean : True or False
#None : Nothing or Null

''' Variables '''

 #variables are used to store the data
 #variables are defined in two ways 
   #type of variable means, what type of data type it is..
   #Kind of variable means, what kind of variable i.e, LOCAL or GLOBAL
   		#Local variable : variable which is defined inside a particular function or defined with indentation and it only belongs locally
   		#Global variable : variable which is defined to the extreme Left wall or etreme left of a console. And it can be accessed
   		                   # globally and locally.
   		# There are Certain points while naming a variable.
   				#Its always reommended that using Lower ase letters or words while creating a variable
   				#Using Underscore(_) is the best option if we have to create a variable using multiple words (ex : data_type = 'int')

x = 10
